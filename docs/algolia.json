[{"content":"Locomotion Technique When we think about locomotion techniques, there are several metrics that need to be considered. The one I wanted to focus on was the \u0026amp;ldquo;Reduction of Cybersickness\u0026amp;rdquo;. When I tried VR for the first time I realised that I myself am very susceptible to cybersickness and that gave me the idea of reducing this sickness as much as possible. The first few things that came to my mind were:\nMove physically or teleport Controller (joystick) shouldn\u0026amp;rsquo;t control the camera Add nose Framerate \u0026amp;gt; 90 FPS Only teleportation and the second option made it into the final version. Why did I not choose to move physically? The answer is simple. We were given the restriction of implementing a locomotion technique that can even be used in confined spaces. Additionally I am very confident that teleportation is less susceptible to cybersickness than moving in place, since moving in place would still create an illusory self-motion in the absence of physical self-motion (vection). In the following picture you can see my locomotion concept:\nIdea ball \u0026amp;amp; teleportation The player can throw a ball to collect coins. If the ball collides with the ground it creates a portal. The player can activate the portal to teleport to the portals position. After activation the portal disappears. I wanted to have some kind of theme that would fit well with my locomotion technique. It took a while to think of something suitable, but in the end I decided to go with a winter theme. The ball thrown by the player shall be a snowball and I wanted to include other things, which will be explained later on, so that the player feels more present. Interaction Task Of course, the winter theme should also be maintained for the interaction task. My idea for the interaction task was to build a snowman instead of fitting the two T-shaped objects. The next image shows my concepts:\nThe interaction task consists of 3 phases.\n1.Phase: Attach the carrot (nose). 2.Phase: Attach the branch (left …","date":1676709992,"description":"","lastmod":"2023-02-18T09:46:32+01:00","objectID":"237538c910909c1675111173c3cc027f","permalink":"https://Lithanel.github.io/Lithanel_page/idea-approach/","publishdate":"2023-02-18T09:46:32+01:00","title":"Idea \u0026 Approach"},{"content":"In the Wintersemester 2022/2023 I decided to participate in the module \u0026amp;ldquo;Interaction in Virtual and Augmented Reality\u0026amp;rdquo;. It only had 15 open spaces, so I am very greatful that I was given one of those. It was very good experience and I can say with confident that my Unity skills greatly improved.\nThe device we were provided with was the \u0026amp;ldquo;Oculus Quest 2\u0026amp;rdquo;:\nOculus Quest 2 We were free to use any unity assets we wanted, but I decided to stay with the Oculus Integration. You can find the asset through this link: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/oculus-integration-82022\nWe were given the task to implement a locomotion and also an interaction technique, which we had to include in a given VR-environment. It was a pre-implemented parkour which we were supposed to improve and adapt. Here are a few screenshots of the standard parkour:\nStandard parkour Standard parkour (other side) Standard parkour (from above) The goal of the parkour is to make a lap using our self implemented locomotion techniques. The player was also supposed to be able to collect coins during the run. We were also assigned to implement an interaction technique, which was to be included in the following locations.\nInteraction tasks locations Standard Interaction Task The interaction task in standard parkour looks like this: The interaction task includes two T-shaped objects. One is more transparent than the other. The player can grab the opaque object. The player must place the opque object on top of the transparent object. The time is and the accuracy is measured.

Therefore we used something integrated in Unity, which called \u0026amp;ldquo;Shader Graph\u0026amp;rdquo;. I have oriented myself on this youtube video from Brackeys: https://youtu.be/IC9g5hlfV6o\nThis was my first try:\nThe shader was not working correctly and instead of covering only the top side of an object, it covered the whole object in snow, which made totally white. The youtube video contained a little older version, which was the reason for this error and after a fix the house looked like this.\nMuch better :) As you can see in the result image the snow only lies on the top layer of the object. This was possible thanks to a raycast from above. The next image contains my Shader Graphs for the snow layer:\nSnow layer (Shader Graphs) The result is like day and night.

What exactly do we need?\nA portal is created at the point of impact of the snowball. Buildings and objects don\u0026amp;rsquo;t count. If the snowball collides with a coin, the coin is collected. Ball is not interrupted. The player can press a button to teleport to the portals location. Teleporter disappears when used. First of all we need a model for the portal. This is the model I came up with:\nThe teleporter is visible even from a distance thanks to the height of the column.\nThe portal is supposed to appear as soon as the the snowball hits the ground. For this purpose I used collider.\nSnowball Collider \u0026amp;amp; Rigidbody The snowball needs to have a Continuous Collision Detection, otherwise in too many cases the ball will fly through objects without being detected. The Trigger will be activated the moment the object is realeased from the hand.\nGround Collider The standard parkour contains street tiles with mesh colliders. The Collider should be set Convex to increase the change of the snowball being detected. In cases like the curve tiles the colliders were not set to Convex, since the portal would float in the air. I set the Rigidbody to Kinematic and activated all the Constraints, as the ground tiles should be not moveable. This image shows the collider of a curve tile. The Mesh Collider is set to convex. If you look at the error you can see that the colliders height is too high compared to the ground in the foreground.\nErrors Collision Detection Error This is my attempt creating the portal without setting the Mesh Collider to Convex.\nThe snowball just disappear into the ground, since some collisions are not detected properly. There were still some snowballs disappearing without creating a portal, even though the Mesh Colliders set to convex.\nThis problem was solved by creating a big platform underneath the map to catch the balls in case they fall through the ground.\nSnowball velocity …","date":1676709992,"description":"","lastmod":"2023-02-18T09:46:32+01:00","objectID":"cc00dec147ee2c7bf1e792e339cfcf37","permalink":"https://Lithanel.github.io/Lithanel_page/teleporter-coins-implementation/","publishdate":"2023-02-18T09:46:32+01:00","title":"Teleporter \u0026 Coins (Implementation)"},{"content":"In this chapter I talk about the throwing method. The throwing method was done by Karl Lewis. I used a lot of his code and approach, so please check out his website if you want to learn how to implement it yourself or maybe you want to know more about the mathematical background. https://karllewisdesign.com/how-to-improve-throwing-physics-in-vr/\nI will just briefly summarize the approach I used. The Oculus Integration Unity Asset already has a grab and release function, but the problem is that it feels very unnatural to throw objects with it. So I just made a few adjustments to my project to make whole process a bit smoother. Here are some important points to pay attention to:\nThe center of mass of the controller. The linear and angular velocity of the controller. These are the two important lines, which made this whole throwing process a lot smoother and natural. The linear and angular velocity have to be considered to get the full throwing velocity, else the throw would neither be accurate nor would it be long.\nVector3 controllerVelocityCross = Vector3.Cross(angularVelocity, m_grabbedObjectPosOff - controllerCenterOfMass); Vector3 fullThrowVelocity = (linearVelocity + cross) * ballSpeed; controllerCenterOfMass = the center of mass of the controller angularVelocity = angular velocity of the controller linearVelocity = linear velocity of the controller controllerVelocityCross = cross ballSpeed = manually inserted number to adjust the velocity ","date":1676709992,"description":"","lastmod":"2023-02-18T09:46:32+01:00","objectID":"4a529e0e986198e7538c3f78002c9cee","permalink":"https://Lithanel.github.io/Lithanel_page/throwing-implementation/","publishdate":"2023-02-18T09:46:32+01:00","title":"Throwing (Implementation)"},{"content":"Interaction in Virtual and Augmented Reality Snowball Parkour Welcome to my university VR-Project about locomotion and interaction.
