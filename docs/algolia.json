[{"content":"When we think about locomotion techniques, there are several metrics that need to be considered. The one I wanted to focus on was the \u0026amp;ldquo;Reduction of Cybersickness\u0026amp;rdquo;. When I tried VR for the first time I realised that I myself am very susceptible to cybersickness and that gave me the idea of reducing this sickness as much as possible. The first few things that came to my mind were:\nMove physically or teleport Controller (joystick) shouldn\u0026amp;rsquo;t control the camera Add nose Framerate \u0026amp;gt; 90 FPS Only teleportation and the second option made it into the final version. Why did I not choose to move physically. The answer is simple. We were given the restriction of implementing a locomotion technique that can even be used in confined spaces. Additionally was confident that teleportation is less susceptible to cybersickness than moving in place, since it would still create an illusory self-motion in the absence of physical self-motion (vection). In the follwing picture you can see my locomotion concept:\nIdea Snowball \u0026amp;amp; Teleportation The player can throw a ball to collect coins. If the ball collides with the ground it creates a portal. The player can activate the portal to teleport to the portals position. After activation the portal disappears.

It only had 15 open spaces, so I am very greatful that I was given one of those. It was very good experience and I can say with confident that my Unity skills greatly improved.\nThe device we were provided with was the \u0026amp;ldquo;Oculus Quest 2\u0026amp;rdquo;:\nOculus Quest 2 We were given the task to implement a locomotion and also an interaction technique, which we had to include in a given VR-environment. It was a pre-implemented parkour which we were supposed to improve and adapt. Here are a few screenshots of the standard parkour:\nStandard parkour Standard parkour (other side) Standard parkour (from above) The goal of the parkour is to make a lap using our self implemented locomotion techniques. The player was also supposed to be able to collect coins during the run. We were also assigned to implement an interaction technique, which was to be included in the following locations.\nInteraction tasks locations ","date":1676709992,"description":"","lastmod":"2023-02-18T09:46:32+01:00","objectID":"4e1314de3ce8f7346ff7c2261dcc8b15","permalink":"https://Lithanel.github.io/Lithanel_page/introduction/","publishdate":"2023-02-18T09:46:32+01:00","title":"Introduction"},{"content":"Interaction in Virtual and Augmented Reality Snowball Parkour Welcome to my university VR-Project about locomotion and interaction.
