## Collect Coins

To collect coins you have to watch for collisions just like with the teleporter.
For the coins i created a seperate tag to ask for this in case of a collision.
If the snowball collides with the coin the coin will be deactivated and the coin counter will be increased by one.<br>
This is how the result looks like: <br>
