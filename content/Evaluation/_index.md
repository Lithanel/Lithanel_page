In this chapter I evaluate my project on different **Metrics of Locomotion (Travel) Techniques** and I also did a survey of 4 people (including myself).
Be aware that this is by **no means a scientific evaluation**. This evaluation is just for fun and it has no solid evidence to support its arguments.
If you still want to stay and read feel free to do so. Thank you for your understanding.

## Metrics of Locomotion (Travel) Techniques

As mentioned in the **Introduction** my main metric and purpose of this project was to **Reduce Cybersickness**.
I had some additional metrics, which were also paid attention to during the development phase: <br>

* Enjoyment
* Presence (being within the environment)
* Ease of Learning
* Spatial Awareness

## Evaluation Results

Please not that every tester had a different amount of experience in VR-Games.

* Tester A: no VR experience
* Tester B: little VR experience, please note that this person already helped me test this game a few times
* Tester C: much VR experience
* Tester D: developer (me)

### Total Throws & Coins Collected

Please note that the left side of the graph shows us the number of total throws until the parkour was cleared. 
Interaction Task throws are not added to this value.
The right of the graph shows us the percentage of coins collected. <br><br>
Every tester approximately needed the same number of throws to clear the parkour. 
Tester C was the only exception, but this person also ignored a high amount of coins.
The rest of the tester aquired 100% of the coins with approximately the same amount of throws.
This result indicates that it there were no unattainably difficult coins in the parkour, so the difficulty was moderate.

### Interaction Task Throws

![2 graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lithanel/Lithanel_page/master/images/evaluation/2_graph.png) <br>

This graph shows us the amount of throws needed the interaction tasks.<br>
```
Interaction 1 = Times nose thrown + Times left arm thrown + Times right arm thrown
```
<br>
We can see from the graph that Tester A, who had no VR experience struggled that most with the interaction task.
Tester A as well as Tester C, who both had no experience with this parkour improved their throwing skills over time.
This result indicates that the skill to throw objects in this project can be aquired fairly easily.<br>
Tester B and D are already experienced from the outset and therefore need few attempts.
This shows us that the throwing mechanism does depend on skill and not that much on luck.

### Metrics

Please note that these metrics were just asked and the answers depend on the testers perception, so there is a high chance that this graph is **biased**.<br>
These were the asked questions:<br>

* How dizzy did you feel during your playthrough? (1 = not dizzy at all, 10 = extremely dizzy)
* How much did you enjoy the game? (1 = extremely boring, 10 = extremely fun)
* How present did you feel during your playthrough? (1 = not present at all, 10 = extremely present)
* How easy do you think was it to learn this game? (1 very easy to learn, 10 = impossible to learn)
* How easy was it for you not to lose your sense of direction? (1 = always lost my sense of direction, 10 = never lost my sense of direction) <br>

![3 graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lithanel/Lithanel_page/master/images/evaluation/3_graph.png) <br>

The results from the graph indicate that the primary metric goal **Reducing Cybersickness** was reached. 
Every tester barely felt dizzy, which made the teleportation technique a good solution to cybersickness.<br>
The second goal of **Enjoyment** was moderate. More features can be added to increase the fun factor.<br>
Every rester assured me that the snowy landscape and the snow animation were definetely an important factor to increase the **Presence** metric.
In this aspect we reached a moderate result.<br>
Regarding the metric **Easy to learn** the parkour should definetely be improved for inexperienced VR-Players. <br>
The metric **Spatial Awareness** delivered moderate - good results.
The snowball **Trail Renderer** and the design of the **Portal** helped the tester to not lose their sense of direction. <br>

## Own Conclusion

This project was a very fun and educational experience. I thank **Prof. Dr. Jan Gugenheimer** for giving me the chance to participate in this module.
It was really fun and in the end I am satisfied with my version of the parkour and also with the evaluation results. 
I also thank all the people who read this insufficient developer blog of mine and hope you could learn a little from my journey or at least enjoy the bugs I provided you with. :)
