In this chapter I evaluate my project on different **Metrics of Locomotion (Travel) Techniques** and I also did a survey of 4 people (including myself).
Be aware that this is by **no means a scientific evaluation**. This evaluation is just for fun and it has no solid evidence to support its arguments.
If you still want to stay and read feel free to do so. Thank you for your understanding.

## Metrics of Locomotion (Travel) Techniques

As mentioned in the **Introduction** my main metric and purpose of this project was to **Reduce Cybersickness**.
I had some additional metrics, which were also paid attention to during the development phase: <br>

* Enjoyment
* Presence (being within the environment)
* Ease of Learning
* Spatial Awareness

## Evaluation Results

Please not that every tester had a different amount of experience in VR-Games.

* Tester A: no VR experience
* Tester B: little VR experience, please note that this person already helped me test this game a few times
* Tester C: much VR experience
* Tester D: developer (me)

## Total Throws & Coins Collected

Please note that the left side of the graph shows us the number of total throws until the parkour was cleared. 
Interaction Task throws are not added to this value.
The right of the graph shows us the percentage of coins collected. <br>
Every tester approximately needed the same number of throws to clear the parkour. 
Tester C was the only exception, but this person also ignored a high amount of coins.
