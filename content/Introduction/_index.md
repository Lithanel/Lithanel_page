In the Wintersemester 2022/2023 I decided to participate in the module "Interaction in Virtual and Augmented Reality".
It only had 15 open spaces, so I am very greatful that I was given one of those.
It was very good experience and I can say with confident that my Unity skills greatly improved.<br><br>
We were given the task to implement a locomotion and also an interaction technique, which we had to include in a given VR-environment.
It was a pre-implemented parkour which we were supposed to improve and adapt.
Here are a few screenshots of the standard parkour:
