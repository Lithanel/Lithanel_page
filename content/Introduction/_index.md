In the Wintersemester 2022/2023 I decided to participate in the module "Interaction in Virtual and Augmented Reality".
It only had 15 open spaces, so I am very greatful that I was given one of those.
It was very good experience and I can say with confident that my Unity skills greatly improved.<br><br>

The device we were provided with was the "Oculus Quest 2":

We were given the task to implement a locomotion and also an interaction technique, which we had to include in a given VR-environment.
It was a pre-implemented parkour which we were supposed to improve and adapt.
Here are a few screenshots of the standard parkour:

The goal of the parkour is to make a lap using our self implemented locomotion techniques. 
The player was also supposed to be able to collect coins during the run.
We were also assigned to implement an interaction technique, which was to be included in the following locations.

### Standard Interaction Task

The interaction task in standard parkour looks like this:

* The interaction task includes two T-shaped objects. One is more transparent than the other.
* The player can grab the opaque object.
* The player must place the opque object on top of the transparent object.
* The time is and the accuracy is measured.
