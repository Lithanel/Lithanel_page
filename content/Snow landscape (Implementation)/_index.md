Since I decided on the winter theme and to give the player the impression that they are in a winter landscape, 
the first thing i wanted to do was cover everything with snow. 
Therefore we used something integrated in Unity, which called "Shader Graph". <br>
I have oriented myself on this youtube video from Brackeys: https://youtu.be/IC9g5hlfV6o

This was my first try:

The next image contains my Shader Graphs for the snow layer:

The result is like day and night. The environment looks totally different:
