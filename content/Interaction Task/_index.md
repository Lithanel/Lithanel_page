Surprisingly, the most time of the project I spent on the Interaction Task. It took several Bugfixes and adjustments to create a proper system,
which doesn't throw any errors and is fun to play. In this chapter I will explain how I implemented the Interaction Task in my project.<br>
First of all I created some models:<br>
